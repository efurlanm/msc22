I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and to its Applied Computing postgraduate course, which enabled my research. Also, I am grateful to my advisor, Stephan Stephany, for his guidance and encouragement, and to the LNCC (National Laboratory for Scientific Computing) for the 205341 AMPEMI 2020-I scholarship, which allowed access to the Santos Dumont supercomputer (SINAPAD node of the Brazilian HPC system).

The current work was accomplished with the support of the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel, Brazil (CAPES - Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, Brasil), Funding Code (Código de Financiamento) 001.
