| st        | Finite difference method to solve the partial differential equations resulting from the Poisson equations for a 2D heat transfer problem. It requires the calculation of a 5-point stencil over the discretized domain grid                 |
| ft        | Fast Fourier transform, used for example in signal and image processing, in which the three-dimensional domain is decomposed, along one dimension, into slices along the chosen dimension                                                   |
| rf        | Random decision forest, used for example for classification and regression tasks, is a machine learning method that operates by creating randomly a combination of decision trees, and in general uses cases trained by a classifier method |
