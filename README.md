# My MSc

Website: <http://efurlanm.github.io/msc22/>

This repository contains material related to my MSc research, including implementations made, and related information.

This research project ran from 2019 to 2022 and resulted in three publications and a conference presentation. The theme of the work consists of implementing toy problems applying Python and Fortran resources in a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment, and evaluating the performance results.
