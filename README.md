| Directory | Description |
|:---:| --- |
| st | The five-point stencil test case, used in a heat transfer problem on a finite surface modeled by the Poison partial differential equation. |
| ft | The three dimensional fast Fourier transform test case, an algorithm that computes the multidimensional Fourier transform of an 3D array using a fast Fourier transform algorithm. |
| rf | The random forest test case, an ensemble learning method for tasks such as classification and regression. |
