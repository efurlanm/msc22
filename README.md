| stencil   | The five-point stencil test case, used in a heat transfer problem on a finite surface modeled by the Poison partial differential equation.                                         |
| fft       | The three dimensional fast Fourier transform test case, an algorithm that computes the multidimensional Fourier transform of an 3D array using a fast Fourier transform algorithm. |
| rforest   | The random forest test case, an ensemble learning method for tasks such as classification and regression.                                                                          |
| thesis    | My original master's thesis in LaTeX format.                                                                                                                                       |
