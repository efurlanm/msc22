# Environment setting

The step-by-step guide for configuring the SDumont environment to use JupyterLab is shown below. It's not a complete guide, just the information I used while doing the work.

After [approval of the proposed use](http://sdumont.lncc.br/call.php?pg=call), or through participation in an existing project, the information necessary for the use of SDumont is sent by email. Some of the following information comes from this email, and the intention here is to only show what I used on my machine. To access the VPN I used the network manager in graphical mode, as described in notebook
