Website: <http://efurlanm.github.io/msc22>

This repo contains the implementations made, miscellaneous materials, and related information.


## Directories

- [stencil][L1] - The five-point stencil test case, used in a heat transfer problem on a finite surface modeled by the Poison partial differential equation
- [fft][L2] - The three dimensional fast Fourier transform test case, an algorithm that computes the multidimensional Fourier transform of an 3D array using a fast Fourier transform algorithm
- [rforest][L3] - The random forest test case, an ensemble learning method for tasks such as classification and regression
- [thesis][L4] - My original master's thesis in LaTeX format
