- [stencil][L1] : The five-point stencil test case, used in a heat transfer problem on a finite surface modeled by the Poison partial differential equation.                                         
- [fft][L2] : The three dimensional fast Fourier transform test case, an algorithm that computes the multidimensional Fourier transform of an 3D array using a fast Fourier transform algorithm.
- [rforest][L3] : The random forest test case, an ensemble learning method for tasks such as classification and regression.
- [thesis][L4] : My original master's thesis in LaTeX format.
